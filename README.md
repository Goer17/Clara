### Getting Started

For optimal deployment, we recommend using Docker to run this web application.

Before deployment, ensure you have:

1. Valid API keys for all required LLM services
2. Docker and Docker Compose installed

Create or modify the `.env` file with your API credentials :

```env
OPENAI_BASE_URL=
OPENAI_API_KEY=

DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
```

Then simply execute :

```shell
docker-compose -p clara up -d
```

Once the containers are running, you can access the **Clara** interface at : http://localhost:8088
